	<h1>ELO Rating Estimator</h1>
	<hr />
	<div id="intro">
		Use this test to get an estimate of your ELO rating. Study each diagram for no more than five minutes, then make your move.
		<p />
		Each position in this page comes from real play by strong players. Beware, <b>not all of these positions are wins for the side on the move,</b> nor
		is the best move necessarily a brilliant one. <i>Try to avoid "cheating" by thinking in terms of finding a combination: </i>there may be none
		available. Instead, concentrate on the position, evaluate it and make the move you would play on the chess board in a real game. This will hopefully
		yield the most precise estimate of your ELO rating.
		<p />
		Some of these positions are pretty easy to play, but most of them are tough. Again, remember that these are real games between strong players. Even
		the losing side (when there was one) might have been of IM/GM strength...
		<p />
		You won't need special moves in these tests (like castling, en passant, or promotions).
